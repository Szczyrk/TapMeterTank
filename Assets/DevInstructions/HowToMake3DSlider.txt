Problem: pivot of 3D object need to be set to the very left so scaling an object looks like the bar is going to the right

1. ProBuilder asset is used for that.
2. The new pivot will be (0,0,0) world position so move/rotate as you want according to that. And REMEMBER that a good practice is to unparent the object first, so you can see object's world position (not local position).
3. Select the object that will be the slider.
4. Open Tools->ProBuilder->Object->ProBuilderize*.
5. You will see a new script attached to the object (probably "Pb_Object").
6. Click "Open ProBuilder" button that is shown in inspector when the object is selected.
7. Click "Freeze Transform" which will move pivot to (0,0,0) world position.
8. It's done :)




* If you want to remove the extra probuilder scripts from your object -  Tools->Probuilder->Actions->Strip ProBuilder Scripts In Selection
